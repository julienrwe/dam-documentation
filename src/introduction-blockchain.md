# Introduction to Blockchain

The internet facilitates the transfer of information through duplication, while the blockchain, created in 2008 with the advent of Bitcoin, enables the transfer of value by ensuring that the data sent to its recipient is removed from the sender's computer.

The blockchain has introduced the concept of scarcity to the digital age, thereby expanding possibilities for asset valuation in a society that is becoming increasingly digitized.

### **What is blockchain?**

Blockchain serves the same functions as a computer - storing, processing, and transferring data. The data is recorded in blocks that are linked together using cryptographic technology, which is why it's called "blockchain". Each block contains unique data that can't be changed or deleted without affecting all the blocks that come after it. That's what makes blockchain both secure and immutable.

ðŸ’¡ The architecture behind Blockchain technology was first described in 1991 when researchers Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta introduced a computer solution that allowed for the timestamping of digital documents, ensuring that they could never be backdated or tampered with.

In summary, it is a registry that stores information in an unalterable and inviolable manner.

*Are there different types of blockchains?

### **Types of blockchain ?**

**Public and Private Blockchains**

- Public blockchains are **open to everyone** with **unrestricted access** to view and participate, as exemplified by Bitcoin.
- Private blockchains, on the other hand, **limit access and usage** of the ledger to **specific actors**, such as certain companies or government agencies. For instance, Goldman Sachs uses blockchain to conduct financial transactions within a predefined network of partners.

There are also blockchains that offer a combination of the benefits of public blockchains (security, decentralization, and transparency) and private blockchains (confidentiality and control)..

### **What are the uses of blockchain?**

Blockchain's value propositions vary depending on its type. Public blockchain offers great transparency: anyone can see transactions and their associated data. Thanks to this visibility, users can be certain that the data is accurate and cannot be altered or falsified.

Public blockchain is also decentralized, meaning that several people manage it and not just one. Decentralization contributes to data security because attacks such as hacking cannot be carried out on a centralized system.

A private blockchain aims to provide more privacy and security. It can be distributed on an architectural level and function without a third party for transactions. The private aspect means that only accredited actors can participate in the management, sharing, validation of transactions and addition of blocks to the chain, according to the consensus protocols defined by the network operator.

### **How do transactions work?**

Processing transactions on a blockchain is straightforward. First, a user sends a transaction to the blockchain, which is then verified by the nodes on the blockchain network to ensure it is valid. Once the transaction is validated, it is added to the blockchain, making it permanently immutable and secure. After that, the transaction is validated, recorded on the blockchain, and completed between the two parties involved in the transaction.

ðŸ’¡ A node *in blockchain jargon* is like a computer or server that is part of the blockchain and connected to the network. It can perform validations, verifications, updates, and transactions. Nodes can be public or private and offer valuable services such as data storage, transaction tracking, or data verification..

Before that, nodes also verify that each transaction is cryptographically secure and verified, which prevents double spending attacks.
