### A secure operational network

Our blockchain-based solution enhances the operational network, which is secured by design, and offers key business benefits such as :

- **Accurate tracking**, all transaction are timestamped and recorded on the blockchain. For each transaction we can ensure that only the owner of the wallet did the transaction and we can trace back all the transactions done by this user.

- **Permanent data storage**, the DAM network is designed such that no one can change the blockchain, once the transaction blocks get added on the chain, no one can go back and change it. Thus, any user on the network won’t be able to edit, delete or update it past transactions.

- **Instantaneous Settlement**, on DAM because of the blockchain technology that we use, transactions are instantaneous and directly written on the blockchain. The settlement is done automatically ensuring that it's the right user that do a transaction, that he has what we want to send and the rights to do so. Also by design we ensure that there is no double spending that can happen on the platform. Since the network do this settlement for you you can ensure fast settlement time on your application with a high level of security.

- **Verifiable and Trustable**, using your own private blockchain network you will be able to create an ecosystem with your partners where you don't need to trust a third party but a system where at any point you can verify that nobody is cheating on the network. Reinventing trust between multiple parties


### **Issuance of digital assets**

The DAM provides a complete and integrated solution for digitizing various assets, such as money, ticketing, loyalty, and vouchers, using blockchain technology. Users can issue digital assets to represent something real or create a purely digital element. Depending on the fungibility of the asset, different types of assets can be successfully issued.


[Introduction tokenization](https://github.com/julienrwe/dam-documentation/blob/5c156e6b374456ec2f7e8c0c2a46b54355dbb941/src/tokenization.md)

![https://worldline.github.io/dam-documentation/screens/AssetTypeDAM.png](https://worldline.github.io/dam-documentation/screens/AssetTypeDAM.png)

On the DAM platform, **fungible assets** refer to items or assets that can be exchanged for other individual items or assets of the same kind. This type of asset can transform physical assets such as cash or gold into digital currency. For example, blockchain tokenization can increase the liquidity of stock options, and enable the issuance of loyalty points and digital gift cards..

On the other hand, **Non-Fungible Assets (NFAs)** are unique and irreplaceable. They cannot be interchanged with other assets of the same type. When used on the DAM platform, this type of asset can digitize physical assets such as fine art or real estate, creating digital assets known as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) that are represented on the blockchain. Moreover, it can be used to issue digital tickets or represent digital titles of ownership.

## Application Areas

**Digital currencies have the potential to bring profound impacts across different areas, such as asset tokenisation, voucher payments, ecosystem money, settlements and CBDCs**.

**Asset tokenisation** enables the digitisation of real-world assets, allowing them to be traded on the blockchain. This opens up a wide range of possibilities, such as fractional ownership, automated compliance, and improved liquidity.

**Voucher payments** allow users to make payments using digital tokens, providing a more secure and efficient way to transfer value.

**Ecosystem money** is a form of digital currency that is used within a specific platform or ecosystem. This can be used to incentivise users, reward loyalty, and facilitate transactions.

**Settlements** are the process of exchanging funds between two parties, and digital currencies can provide a faster, more secure way to complete these transactions.

**Finally, CBDCs** are digital versions of fiat currencies, allowing central banks to issue digital money that can be used for payments and other financial services. By providing a more efficient way to transfer value, CBDCs can help to reduce costs and improve financial inclusion.
