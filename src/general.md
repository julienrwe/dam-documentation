In recent years, the payments system has undergone significant changes. For example, payment automation has become more common, accelerating transaction speed and improving client convenience. The appearance of cashierless stores is another major breakthrough. Furthermore, the integration of mobile applications into the payment process has streamlined it for customers and lessens the need for physical cards.

Thanks to the disruptive impact of blockchain technology, innovation hasn’t slowed down. New payment apps are already being developed using this decentralized ledger, which has a number of advantages like improved security and increased transparency.

In a world where digitization is on the rise, **blockchain enables the representation of value online and allows for easy digitization of real-world assets**. It can help businesses **streamline their processes by incorporating their own business rules into a shared ecosystem** as well. All information stored on the database is unalterable and immutable, and can be verified at any time.

This transparency provides distributors and merchants with a more efficient value chain, resulting in reduced operating costs and a top-notch customer experience. **This is the essence of what the World Digital Currency solution has to offer.**

<u>Today’s challenges</u>

- **No digital native payment** : complex and costly solution not fitting in a digital world

- **Hard to maintain genuine trust with multiple partners** : need of centralized third-party authority

- **Complexe to create and maintain a business ecosystem** : expensive and time consuming to coordonate with partners and their solutions

<u>Adopting digital assets</u>

- **Create new services never possible before** : own your fully digital ecosystem and <u>reinvent how value flows</u>. Build a new offering with multiple interacting digital assets on an all-in-one platform.

## Application Areas

**Assets digitazation can totally transform many industries, through voucher payment, ecosystem currency, faster transactional settlement or even a central bank digital currency (CBDC).**

On a blockchain, **asset digitization** can enable fractional ownership, automated compliance, and improved liquidity.

With **voucher payments**, digital tokens are used for payment, making it a safer, more efficient, and cheaper alternative to traditional value transfer methods.

**Ecosystem currency** is a form of digital currency used within a specific platform or environment. This can incentivize users, reward loyalty, and facilitate transactions.

**Settlements** involve the exchange of funds between two parties, and digital currencies can provide a faster and more secure way to conduct these transactions.

**CBDCs** are essentially digital versions of fiat currencies, allowing central banks to issue digital money that can be used for payments and other financial services. By complementing existing payment methods, **CBDCs** can help improve financial inclusivity and contribute to monetary stability by providing more flexibility.

### How to put it into practice ?

From your management area, you can create as many assets as you want and deploy them to the beneficiaries you choose. Each issued token is tracked on a private digital database that only you can access, along with the corresponding data. Converting from fiat to digital currency, or vice versa, is a simple process that takes just a few click.

### A secure operational network

Our blockchain-based solution enhances the operational network, which is secured by design, and offers key business benefits such as :

- **Accurate tracking** : all transaction are timestamped and recorded on the blockchain. For each transaction we can ensure that only the owner of the wallet did the transaction and we can trace back all the transactions done by this user.

- **Permanent data storage** : once a transaction is confirmed, it is recorded in a block that will add it to chain of blocks containing previously completed transactions. No one can go back and modify them. Hence, no user of the network will be able to alter, delete or update past transactions.

- **Instantaneous Settlement** : the underlying technology of the network allows instant settlement of transactions without the risk of double spending or error with a high level of security.

- **Verifiable and Trustable** : using your own private blockchain network you will be able to create an ecosystem with your partners where you don't need to trust a third party but a system where at any point you can verify that nobody is cheating on the network. Reinventing trust between multiple parties


### **Issuance of digital assets**

As **our product offers a comprehensive and integrated solution for the digitization of various assets**. It is also possible to assign a value to a purely fictional asset by giving it a digital representation. Tokenization is the term used to describe this digitization of assets. It is essential to take into account the fungibility of the digital asset, which determines how it's managed, regardless of its representation.


[Introduction tokenization](https://github.com/julienrwe/dam-documentation/blob/5c156e6b374456ec2f7e8c0c2a46b54355dbb941/src/tokenization.md)

On Worldline's digital currency platform, there are two types of assets : **fungible and non-fungible**. 
**Fungible assets** are interchangeable because they do not have unique properties. 
Examples of **fungible assets** include tokenized water or gold, which can be traded based on their assigned value.

Nevertheless, if tokens represent unique assets, they cannot be exchanged for each other. Instead, they can only be purchased using accepted means of exchange. These unique assets are called **non-fungible assets**, which have gained popularity through the use of NFTs. **Non-fungible asset**s are well-suited for art or real estate.

### **Day-to-day running tailored to your business issues** 

**Configure assets according to your need**

Our product is designed to provide lots of helpful business rules that can help streamline your operations, giving you more time and money-saving opportunities! Plus, it can ensure efficient and effective processes. It can integrate rules over transactions, whitelist and blacklist merchants, and even automate loyalty schemes and cashback systems - making it an incredibly versatile tool that can provide more than just payment and power services for any ecosystem.

For instance, imagine creating a token called "WL coin". You can establish a rule to reward loyalty tokens when a transaction hits a specific threshold, such as 50 euros. Each 50 euro transaction will earn the consumer a certain number of loyalty tokens, to be determined by the issuer. The entire process is automated. Additionally, the use of these tokens can be limited to specific parameters in the rule settings. The goal is to establish a framework for optimizing and increasing the value of your assets.
