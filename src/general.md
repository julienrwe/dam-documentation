## Discover the DAM

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to changes in the way businesses and organizations operate worldwide. To survive and succeed in an ever-changing environment, they have had to adapt and change their strategies. In the payments sector, major changes have taken place such as payment automation, cashierless stores, and the integration of mobile applications to improve the customer experience. Moreover, new applications are emerging due to the rise of Blockchain technology.

As digitization continues to expand, **Blockchain technology provides the ability to represent value online with a focus on transparency and interoperability**. The fundamental aim of blockchain is to empower users by providing them with greater choice and control. Given the increasing prevalence of multichannel, prioritizing user experience can truly make it effective.

Moreover, the technology enables **the effortless digitization of real-world assets and assists businesses in streamlining their processes by incorporating their own business rules into a shared ecosystem**. Users can interact with each other without the need for a third party intermediary. All information recorded on the Blockchain is unfalsifiable, immutable, and can be verified at any time.

This simplification offers distributors and merchants a more efficient value chain, leading to a reduction in operating costs and a seamless customer experience. **This is the essence of what DAM proposes**

### ** A new era of payments**
***What if you could create your own digital payment ecosystem and leverage it to become your competitve edge ?***

### A secure operational network

Our blockchain-based solution enhances the operational network, which is secured by design, and offers key business benefits such as :

- **Accurate tracking**, all transaction are timestamped and recorded on the blockchain. For each transaction we can ensure that only the owner of the wallet did the transaction and we can trace back all the transactions done by this user.

- **Permanent data storage**, the DAM network is designed such that no one can change the blockchain, once the transaction blocks get added on the chain, no one can go back and change it. Thus, any user on the network won’t be able to edit, delete or update it past transactions.

- **Instantaneous Settlement**, on DAM because of the blockchain technology that we use, transactions are instantaneous and directly written on the blockchain. The settlement is done automatically ensuring that it's the right user that do a transaction, that he has what we want to send and the rights to do so. Also by design we ensure that there is no double spending that can happen on the platform. Since the network do this settlement for you you can ensure fast settlement time on your application with a high level of security.

- **Verifiable and Trustable**, using your own private blockchain network you will be able to create an ecosystem with your partners where you don't need to trust a third party but a system where at any point you can verify that nobody is cheating on the network. Reinventing trust between multiple parties


### **Issuance of digital assets**
**A comprehensive and integrated solution for digitizing various assets is offered by our product**. It is also possible to attach a value to a purely fictional asset by giving it a digital representation. Tokenization is the term used to describe this asset digitalization. It's critical to take into account the digital asset's fungibility, which determines its management mode, regardless of the representation it has.


[Introduction tokenization](https://github.com/julienrwe/dam-documentation/blob/5c156e6b374456ec2f7e8c0c2a46b54355dbb941/src/tokenization.md)

On Worldline's digital currency platform, there are two types of assets: **fungible and non-fungible**. **Fungible assets** are interchangeable because they do not have unique properties. Examples of **fungible assets** include tokenized water or gold, which can be traded based on their assigned value.

Nevertheless, if tokens represent unique assets, they cannot be exchanged for each other. Instead, they can only be purchased using accepted means of exchange. These unique assets are called **non-fungible assets**, which have gained popularity through the use of NFTs. **Non-fungible asset**s are well-suited for art or real estate.

### **Structure of the solution**


## Application Areas

**Digital currencies have the potential to bring profound impacts across different areas, such as asset tokenisation, voucher payments, ecosystem money, settlements and CBDCs**.

**Asset tokenisation** enables the digitisation of real-world assets, allowing them to be traded on the blockchain. This opens up a wide range of possibilities, such as fractional ownership, automated compliance, and improved liquidity.

**Voucher payments** allow users to make payments using digital tokens, providing a more secure and efficient way to transfer value.

**Ecosystem money** is a form of digital currency that is used within a specific platform or ecosystem. This can be used to incentivise users, reward loyalty, and facilitate transactions.

**Settlements** are the process of exchanging funds between two parties, and digital currencies can provide a faster, more secure way to complete these transactions.

**Finally, CBDCs** are digital versions of fiat currencies, allowing central banks to issue digital money that can be used for payments and other financial services. By providing a more efficient way to transfer value, CBDCs can help to reduce costs and improve financial inclusion.
