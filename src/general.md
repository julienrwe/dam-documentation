## Discover the DAM

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to changes in the way businesses and organizations operate worldwide. To survive and succeed in an ever-changing environment, they have had to adapt and change their strategies. In the payments sector, major changes have taken place such as payment automation, cashierless stores, and the integration of mobile applications to improve the customer experience. Moreover, new applications are emerging due to the rise of Blockchain technology.

As digitization continues to expand, **Blockchain technology provides the ability to represent value online with a focus on transparency and interoperability**. The fundamental aim of blockchain is to empower users by providing them with greater choice and control. Given the increasing prevalence of multichannel, prioritizing user experience can truly make it effective.

Moreover, the technology enables **the effortless digitization of real-world assets and assists businesses in streamlining their processes by incorporating their own business rules into a shared ecosystem**. Users can interact with each other without the need for a third party intermediary. All information recorded on the Blockchain is unfalsifiable, immutable, and can be verified at any time.

This simplification offers distributors and merchants a more efficient value chain, leading to a reduction in operating costs and a top notch customer experience. **This is the essence of what DAM proposes**

### **A new era of payments**

### A secure operational network

Our blockchain-based solution enhances the operational network, which is secured by design, and offers key business benefits such as :

- **Accurate tracking** : all transaction are timestamped and recorded on the blockchain. For each transaction we can ensure that only the owner of the wallet did the transaction and we can trace back all the transactions done by this user.

- **Permanent data storage** : once a transaction is confirmed, it is recorded in a block that will add it to chain of blocks containing previously completed transactions. No one can go back and modify them. Hence, no user of the network will be able to alter, delete or update past transactions.

- **Instantaneous Settlement**, the underlying technology of the network allows instant settlement of transactions without the risk of double spending or error with a high level of security.

- **Verifiable and Trustable**, using your own private blockchain network you will be able to create an ecosystem with your partners where you don't need to trust a third party but a system where at any point you can verify that nobody is cheating on the network. Reinventing trust between multiple parties


### **Issuance of digital assets**
**A comprehensive and integrated solution for digitizing various assets is offered by our product**. It is also possible to attach a value to a purely fictional asset by giving it a digital representation. Tokenization is the term used to describe this asset digitalization. It's critical to take into account the digital asset's fungibility, which determines its management mode, regardless of the representation it has.


[Introduction tokenization](https://github.com/julienrwe/dam-documentation/blob/5c156e6b374456ec2f7e8c0c2a46b54355dbb941/src/tokenization.md)

On Worldline's digital currency platform, there are two types of assets: **fungible and non-fungible**. **Fungible assets** are interchangeable because they do not have unique properties. Examples of **fungible assets** include tokenized water or gold, which can be traded based on their assigned value.

Nevertheless, if tokens represent unique assets, they cannot be exchanged for each other. Instead, they can only be purchased using accepted means of exchange. These unique assets are called **non-fungible assets**, which have gained popularity through the use of NFTs. **Non-fungible asset**s are well-suited for art or real estate.

## Application Areas

**Tokenization has the potential to make a big impact in several areas, including asset digitization, voucher payments, ecosystem currency, settlements, and CBDC.**

On the blockchain, **asset digitization** can enable fractional ownership, automated compliance, and improved liquidity.

With **voucher payments**, digital tokens are used for payment, making it a safer, more efficient, and cheaper alternative to traditional value transfer methods.

**Ecosystem currency** is a form of digital currency used within a specific platform or environment. This can incentivize users, reward loyalty, and facilitate transactions.

**Settlements** involve the exchange of funds between two parties, and digital currencies can provide a faster and more secure way to conduct these transactions.

**CBDCs** are essentially digital versions of fiat currencies, allowing central banks to issue digital money that can be used for payments and other financial services. By complementing existing payment methods, **CBDCs** can help improve financial inclusivity and contribute to monetary stability by providing more flexibility.


**Let's explore how Worldline Digital Currency can be utilized with theses examples**
