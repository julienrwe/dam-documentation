# Introduction to tokenization

Blockchain is analogous to the internet in terms of its value. Just as the internet revolutionized the way information is shared, **tokenization of assets and goods is ready to revolutionize the way value is exchanged**. This includes digitizing paper documents, works of art, financial assets, and real estate.

In this article, we will provide an overview of tokenization, how it works, and the associated benefits.

### **What is tokenization**

Tokenization is the concept of taking real, physical or virtual items and making them digital. Not only does this make them secure and digital, but it also helps to exchange, buy and transfer them more easily, quickly and even instantly. Tokenization is the process, and the token is what you get at the end. It's a new way of thinking about ownership in the digital age.

### **What are the characteristics of tokenization?**

As the blockchain is accessible to everyone without prior control, it is possible for anyone to create their own token. These tokens can be generated at any time and adapted for various uses thanks to their modular design. They are highly liquid and their virtual nature allows for easy transfer.

It should be noted that tokens are recorded on the blockchain, an immutable and inviolable database, which offers an additional layer of security to tokenized assets.

### What benefits can be gained from tokenization?

The advantages of tokenization for applications are numerous, including improved operational efficiency through the use of blockchain. This allows for streamlining of computer systems and infrastructure sharing without the involvement of a third party, which significantly reduces transaction costs. Additionally, the automation of manual tasks and the reduction of compliance and reconciliation processes also contribute to reducing inefficiencies. As a result, **efficiency can be improved at a lower cost**.

The digital transformation of assets allows us to subdivide them into several components. This offers increased accessibility for assets that cannot be divided in real life. **The divisibility of assets therefore introduces the concept of shared ownership**, where multiple people can purchase an asset together and benefit from it. This form of sharing is essential as usage tends to supplant ownership.

In addition, geographical and infrastructural limitations, as well as high minimum investment thresholds, are removed, which contributes to better inclusion.

The blockchain provides some transparency, as all transactions made on it are visible to all users. The assets that are tokenized on it are therefore traceable, as everyone can see how they move.

For physical assets, this transparency allows for better traceability and provides confidence in their origin and provenance. Owners and the chain of ownership of these assets can be easily identified.

But sometimes transparency is not desirable and even counterproductive. For example, no one wants to share their success secrets with their competitors. In these cases, private blockchains are used to restrict sensitive information to a limited circle of participants.

Today, big data is becoming increasingly important and every asset generates a considerable amount of data. However, it is sometimes **difficult to link these data points** due to intellectual property, rights, and licenses **that do not allow for optimal interoperability**. As a result, these **fragmented data points** are mainly accessible and this makes economic management unfeasible and generates unnecessary efforts. Fortunately, there is room for progress in managing these data more effectively.

The blockchain allows business partners and even competitors to share a common database, improving efficiency across the value chain and opening up new possibilities for collaboration among ecosystem actors.

It offers asset owners the ability to tokenize and sell them on digital markets. This innovation allows users to diversify their portfolios and access assets that would otherwise be inaccessible to them.

Tokenization also offers the ability to split assets and sell them to smaller participants. Thus, it allows small investors to access assets.

### **Types of Tokens**

The blockchain industry is composed of four distinct categories of tokens: utility tokens, governance tokens, security tokens, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Each of them is associated with a value and serves different purposes.

Utility tokens were designed for specific uses on the blockchain. They are the most commonly used type of token, particularly to provide access to services or goods.

They are also used for staking and liquidity mining. Users can invest in them by locking up tokens or lending crypto tokens, and receive interest in the form of coins or additional tokens in return.

Utility tokens can also be used to set up loyalty programs. Points in the form of tokens granted to eCommerce users can be converted into discounts when they buy specific products or participate in promotional campaigns.

Security tokens are the cryptographic equivalent of traditional securities such as stocks and bonds. They are mainly used to sell shares in companies or parts of Real Estate Investment Trusts. These tokens represent ownership of a real investment product and this information is securely stored and recorded on the blockchain. More and more companies are exploring security tokens as an alternative to other financing methods.

Tokenization also allows granting rights such as ownership of a token. These tokens are called governance tokens. They are designed to give holders specific rights, such as the right to vote on the blockchain, access to premium services, and rewards.

If we wanted to be precise, it would have been necessary to differentiate tokens that are interchangeable from those that have a unique intrinsic value. The latter are considered non-fungible. They are commonly known as NFTs. Contrary to popular belief, they are not exclusively linked to digital artwork. In reality, they can be used in a variety of projects such as gaming, sports, fashion, education, eCommerce, and government. The value proposition of an NFT is undeniable. It is a proof of digital authenticity that indicates that the user owns a unique asset.
